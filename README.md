# Chaperone

Chaperone is a smartphone loss prevention solution based on active acoustic sensing.
It proactively sends an inaudible acoustic signal and analyzes its echoes to
estimate the user's motion state and detect if the user is leaving. The repository
provides the source code of Chaperone and experiment scripts as well as other
supplementary materials. It consists of three folders:

- **demo:** the Android source code of Chaperone demo  
- **evaluation:** Python scripts for the experiments in the Chaperone paper
- **user_study:** supplementary document for the user study in the Chaperone paper

Please refer to the ```README.md``` file in each folder for details.
